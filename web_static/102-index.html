                    <p>This house is an old Japanese traditional house built in 1948. We renovated inside so it is very clean and comfortable. I am an artist There is a kitchen and living area at the1st floor and you can see the little Japanese garden from
                        it. The 2nd floor is an also traditional tatami room and sleep with Japanese style of bed (FUTON) so you will have real Japanese life style at our place.

                            <p>We had an incredible time staying with Walid. His apartment is located directly next to the Giza Pyramid Complex and private balconies offer an outstanding view. The apartment was spacious and clean. A nice touch of hospitality with bottled water and fruits was present in the kitchen. Cooling/Heat available in bedrooms. We needed the heat for it gets chilly at night in Feb.
                                In addition to being host, Walid was also our guide visiting Cairo. He did a fantastic job making arrangements for us, so we did not have to worry about getting around Egypt. We relaxed and had a great time!
                                Overall, I highly recommend Walid and his apartment! Will be back in the future.

                    <p>Serene courtyards, lily pools, and a rooftop terrace with a circular dining sala set a reflective tone at this traditional Thai villa near Dream Beach Club. Glass walls, marble floors, and rain showers strike a contemporary theme inside.
                        Cue the sound system, hit the gym, and swim in the infinity pool with epic ocean views, or check out the resort's library and spa. Ton Sai Waterfall is a 6-mile drive.
